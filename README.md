# School System @ OpenMinds


Our program have to part:
- web
- console


## Story

We created a simple school system with a web user interface. The program is made for two type of users. One of them is the applicant, who can apply to the school, and the other is the admin, who can filter the applicants' data using different filters.




## Technical details

In this project we use the following technologies:

1.) Python (for writing the software)

2.) PostgreSQL (for storing all the data)

3.) Peewee ORM (to map the data and use objects)

4.) Psycopg2 PostgreSQL adapter

5.) Flask micro-framework

6.) validate_email to verify  email addresses



## Web Usage


1.) You have to run ```main.py``` at least once to build the database!  You can close it if you would like to use the web interface. :)

2.) Run ```server.py ```, and open the link shown on your console.


## Console Usage


1.) You have to run ```main.py``` .
Follow the instructions on the screen.
The menu will start automatically and you can choose from the options.


(The Console is a little out-of-date, so you should use it just on your own responsibility.)
